	 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a computational concept that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm is one that minimizes this time complexity, ensuring faster execution as the input size grows.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. It is expressed as a function, such as O(n), where n represents the size of the input data. Understanding space complexity helps in optimizing the memory usage of algorithms.</p>
